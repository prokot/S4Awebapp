# S4A Web App

Simple web app implementing JPA, spring, H2 Database and a simple front-end gui made with Node.js.

## Installation
The java project is made with maven, I would recommend using IntelliJ to run the project,as this is the IDE I used.

To initialize the web server simply go to ```front/``` directory and run:
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm run dev
```

## Testing
Additionally, I added basic http requests (using IntelliJ HTTP Client). 
They can be executed using IntelliJ IDE.

##H2 Database
The database can be accessed [here](http://localhost:8081/h2-console).
Login: ```admin```
Password: ```adminadmin```
