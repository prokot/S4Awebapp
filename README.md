# S4A Web App

Simple web app implementing JPA, spring, H2 Database and a simple front-end gui made with Node.js.

## Installation
The java project is made with maven, I would recommend using IntelliJ to run the project,as this is the IDE I used.

To initialize the web server simply go to ```front/``` directory and run:
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
